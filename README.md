## System Design

  --> Software + Hardware + Network + Processess. eg:A Social Media App (Facebook,Instagram) The Whole App.
  
  --> System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system  so that it meets the end-user requirements.

  --> ***Scalability*** and ***Reliability***: System design ensures systems can grow and handle increased demand without failure.

  --> **Efficient Resource Management**: It helps in optimizing resource allocation, ensuring fast and responsive applications.

The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

### High-Level Design (HLD)
It lays out the overall architecture of the system â€” how major components interact, what services or modules will exist, and how data flows among them.

Gives you the big picture: how the system fits together, its core structure, and major decisions.
Done by architects, stakeholders and managers.

### Low-Leve Design (LLD)
Gives developers a clear, actionable blueprint to build each component.
Once a High Level Design is built by stakeholders, it is the job of senior developers and designers to create a low level design.

## Steps for getting started with System Design

  1. Understand the requirements:
     Before you begin designing the system, you need to understand the requirements. This involves talking to stakeholders and users, reviewing existing documentation, and analyzing the business processes that the system will support.

  2. Define the system architecture:
     Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can begin defining the system architecture. This involves identifying the major components of the system and the interfaces between them.
  3. Choose the technology stack:
     Based on the requirements and the system architecture, you can select the technology stack. This includes choosing the programming language, database, frameworks, and libraries that will be used to implement the system.
  4. Design the modules:
     you need to design the modules that will make up the system. This involves defining the functions that each module will perform and the data that it will manipulate.
  5. Plan for scalability:
     As you design the system, you need to consider how it will scale. This involves identifying potential bottlenecks and designing the system to handle increased loads.
  6. Consider security and privacy:
    Security and privacy should be a key consideration in system design. This involves identifying potential security threats and designing the system to mitigate them.
  7. Test and validate:
     Once the system design is complete, you need to test and validate it. This involves creating test cases and scenarios that simulate real-world usage and verifying that the system meets the requirements.

### Examples of Functional and Non-functional Requirements
 

1. Online Banking System

    1. Functional Requirements:
       Users should be able to log in with their username and password.
       Users should be able to check their account balance.
       Users should receive notifications after making a transaction.

    2. Non-functional Requirements:
       The system should respond to user actions in less than 2 seconds.
       All transactions must be encrypted and comply with industry security standards.
       The system should be able to handle 100 million users with minimal downtime.
